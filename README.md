# HW-1-Portfolio
First homework assignment working with HTML/CSS

I couldn't figure out how to add text to the images in the Portfolio page. I will have to keep working on flexboxes and aligning content. Positioning still confuses me as it doesn't seem to like working for me. 

I added a submit page for the Contact "submit button", to make it seem like it does something. Plus another button to take you to the about page.
